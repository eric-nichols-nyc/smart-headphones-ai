# Chatbot Phase 1: Basic Chat Interface PRD

## Overview
This phase focuses on implementing the foundational UI components for the chatbot interface. The goal is to create a clean, functional chat window that will serve as the base for future AI integration.

## Technical Requirements
- Next.js 15.3.1
- React 19.0.0
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety

## Core Features

### 1. Chat Window Container
- Fixed position in the bottom-right corner of the screen
- Expandable/collapsible functionality
- Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
- z-index handling to overlay other content

### 2. Message Display Area
- Scrollable message container
- Clear message bubbles for both user and system messages
- Visual distinction between user and system messages
- Auto-scroll to latest message
- Proper handling of long messages

### 3. Input Interface
- Text input field
- Send button
- Enter key submission support
- Basic input validation
- Clear input after sending

### 4. Basic State Management
- Local state for messages
- Basic message structure (timestamp, sender, content)
- Temporary message storage (no persistence required in Phase 1)

## UI/UX Requirements
- Clean, modern design consistent with the main application
- Smooth animations for expand/collapse
- Loading states (preparation for future API integration)
- Clear visual feedback for user actions
- Accessibility considerations (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

## Out of Scope for Phase 1
- AI integration
- Message persistence
- User authentication
- Advanced features (attachments, rich text, etc.)
- Backend integration

## Success Criteria
1. Users can open and close the chat window
2. Users can type and send messages
3. Messages are displayed in the correct order
4. UI is responsive and works on mobile devices
5. Basic animations and transitions work smoothly

## Future Considerations
- Prepare for AI service integration in Phase 2
- Design component structure for easy extension
- Plan for state management scaling
- Consider performance optimization points
