      "taskTitle": "Chat Window Container Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Chat Window Container Implementation into 4 subtasks covering component structure, positioning, expand/collapse functionality, and integration with existing components.",
      "reasoning": "Medium complexity as it involves implementing a component using existing code as reference. The task requires understanding of component architecture, positioning, and state management for expand/collapse functionality."

      "taskTitle": "Message Display Area Development",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Message Display Area Development into 4 subtasks covering scrollable container implementation, message bubble styling for different sender types, timestamp display, and message wrapping functionality.",
      "reasoning": "Moderate complexity that involves creating UI components with different styling based on message type. Requires implementation of scrolling behavior and proper message formatting."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Input Interface Creation",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Input Interface Creation into 4 subtasks covering input field implementation, send button functionality, validation logic, and keyboard shortcut support.",
      "reasoning": "Relatively straightforward UI implementation with basic form validation and event handling. The component has clear requirements and limited scope."

      "taskTitle": "Basic State Management Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Basic State Management Implementation into 5 subtasks covering message state structure, message addition functionality, system message generation, data passing to child components, and auto-scroll implementation.",
      "reasoning": "Medium complexity as it involves managing state across components, implementing helper functions, and handling auto-scroll behavior which requires DOM manipulation."

      "taskTitle": "Animation and Transition Refinement",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Animation and Transition Refinement into 5 subtasks covering expand/collapse animations, message entrance effects, loading state indicators, interactive element states, and performance optimization.",
      "reasoning": "Higher complexity due to the need for smooth, performant animations that enhance UX without causing performance issues. Requires detailed CSS knowledge and testing."

      "taskTitle": "Accessibility Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Accessibility Implementation into 5 subtasks covering ARIA attribute implementation, keyboard navigation support, color contrast verification, screen reader testing, and focus management.",
      "reasoning": "High complexity as accessibility requires specialized knowledge, thorough testing with assistive technologies, and careful attention to detail across all interactive elements."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Initial Message and Welcome State",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Initial Message and Welcome State into 4 subtasks covering welcome message content creation, initial state implementation, new user indicators, and integration with existing message display.",
      "reasoning": "Lower complexity task focused on creating initial content and state. Requirements are clear and the scope is limited to initialization logic."
    },

      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Integration Testing and Success Criteria Validation",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Integration Testing and Success Criteria Validation into 5 subtasks covering functional testing, responsive design testing, animation verification, accessibility validation, and edge case identification.",
      "reasoning": "Higher complexity due to the comprehensive nature of testing against all success criteria. Requires systematic approach to verify functionality across different conditions and devices."
